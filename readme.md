## SimpleChat - React
This is my first react app so this might have errors...
I am also aware of the error shown in developer console about className, which im not sure how to fix.

## Running the api/server

```
$ cd server
$ npm install
$ node .
```

Then it should be online on port 81 ( http://localhost:81/ )

## Running the frontend (developer)

```
$ cd client
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Then it should be online on port 3000 ( http://localhost:3000/ )

## Building the frontend

```
$ cd client
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Running the built frontend

```
$ cd client
$ npm i -g serve
$ serve -s build
```

Then it should be online on port 3000 ( http://localhost:3000/ )
